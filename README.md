This is a fork of [indiefan/home_assistant_nanit](https://github.com/indiefan/home_assistant_nanit), which itself is a fork of the original [adam.stanek/nanit](https://gitlab.com/adam.stanek/nanit) project (no longer maintained). This version includes significant enhancements including 2FA support, web dashboard, historical tracking, and modern streaming capabilities.

# Installation & Setup

## Quick Start

1. **Pull and run the container:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=nanit \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 1935:1935 \
  -e NANIT_RTMP_ADDR=YOUR_LOCAL_IP:1935 \
  deltathreed/nanit-web
```

2. **Open the web dashboard:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080`
   - If not yet configured, you'll be redirected to the setup page

3. **Complete setup via web interface:**
   - Enter your Nanit email and password
   - Enter the 2FA code sent to your email
   - The system will automatically start monitoring your baby
   - Dashboard will display live data, charts, and video stream

**Security Note:** The refresh token provides full access to your Nanit account. Protect your system and proceed at your own risk.

# Integrations

## Home Assistant

### MQTT Auto-Discovery (Recommended)

When MQTT is enabled, the application automatically creates Home Assistant entities:

- **Camera**: RTMP video feed
- **Sensors**: Temperature, humidity, day/night status
- **Binary Sensors**: Night mode, streaming status
- **Switches**: Night light, standby mode

Simply enable MQTT in your configuration and devices will appear automatically.

### Manual Camera Setup

Alternatively, add a camera manually to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
camera:
  - name: Nanit
    platform: ffmpeg
    input: rtmp://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:1935/local/YOUR_BABY_UID
```

You can find your `baby_uid` in the web dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` or in the application logs.

# FAQ

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Video streaming fails but sensor data still works?
**A: Connection Limit Errors** - The most common issue is **"too many local connections"** to the Nanit camera:

- **Symptoms**: Video stream fails to connect, but sensor data continues working
- **Cause**: Nanit cameras limit concurrent local streaming connections
- **Behavior**: App continuously retries connection attempts
- **Impact**: Usually doesn't affect the official Nanit mobile app

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait and retry**: Connection limits may clear after a few minutes
2. **Restart the container**: `docker restart nanit`
3. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure camera and app are on same network
4. **Verify RTMP address**: Make sure `NANIT_RTMP_ADDR` uses correct local IP

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Sensor data continues**: Temperature, humidity, day/night status still update
- **Automatic retries**: App persistently attempts to reconnect
- **Mobile app unaffected**: Official Nanit app typically continues working
- **Eventually connects**: Usually succeeds after some time

### Q: How do I check what's going wrong?
**A:** Check the application logs using the Docker commands from the Installation section:
```bash
# Real-time logs
docker logs -f nanit
# Recent logs  
docker logs --tail 100 nanit
```

### Q: Can I access this remotely/over the internet?
**A:** This should **NOT be exposed directly to the public internet**. For remote access:
- Use a VPN to access your home network
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy) with proper authentication and HTTPS
- Never rely solely on the built-in password protection

## Security & Safety

### Q: Is this safe to use?
**A:** This application accesses your Nanit account and camera feeds. Important considerations:

**Security Risks:**
- **Refresh tokens provide full Nanit account access**
- **Live video streams from your baby's room** 
- **Historical data about your home environment**
- **Device control capabilities**

**Recommendations:**
- Use only within your home network
- Enable the built-in password protection
- Access via local IP addresses (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
- **Never expose directly to the internet**

### Q: What are the legal disclaimers?
**A:** This is a personal project provided as-is for educational and personal use. **I am not responsible for any issues, damages, or consequences that may arise from using this software.**

**Use at your own risk:**
- This software accesses your Nanit account and camera feeds
- No warranty or support is provided
- You are responsible for securing your own installation
- Any misuse or security issues are your responsibility

By using this software, you acknowledge that you understand the risks and accept full responsibility for its use.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What ports does this use?
**A:** 
- **Port 8080**: Web dashboard interface
- **Port 1935**: RTMP streaming (for Home Assistant and other RTMP clients)

### Q: Where do I find my baby_uid?
**A:** Your `baby_uid` is displayed in the web dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` or can be found in the application logs.

### Q: Do I need to be on the same network as my Nanit camera?
**A:** Yes, your Docker host must be on the same network as your Nanit camera, and you must use your local IP address (not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`) in the `NANIT_RTMP_ADDR` setting.
